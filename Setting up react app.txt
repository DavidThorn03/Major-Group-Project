Setting up react app

- create app (where you want to create it)- npx create-expo@latest

- start dev server (in app folder)- npx expo start

- scan QR code generated




- without android phone - need android emulator (only one I know is android studios)
more on that here: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated
